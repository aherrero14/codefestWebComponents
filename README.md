# WebComponents like a Ninja

This is the source code used in the lecture given at codeFEST 2018. This lecture shows how to build a WebComponent following all the standards but with the best advantages of JSX and TypeScript. So, in order to achieve this, we will write the web component in Stencil and it will be compiled and reused in base apps (Angular, ReactJS and Vuew versions).
